# [Code-Quiz](https://raffee1989.github.io/Code-Quiz/)

## Description
This homework was challenging to me but I was able to make it thanks to [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) website. This is a multiple-choice quiz with a timer. Ones the user click on start button, the timer runs. User has 75 seconds to answer 5 question. If the user come up with a wrong answer, 10 seconds will be deducted from total countdonw. The app will display the result and score of user at the end wether the user wins or losses. User has the option to play again and stores its recoreds in View Highscores. 

## Mock-UP
Below you can see an screenshot of how the app looks like.

## Additional Work
I used [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to style the buttons. 

I used [Birtful](https://www.brightful.me/blog/multiple-choice-trivia-questions-and-answers) website to pick the questions.
